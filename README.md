Weather APP Using the Dark Sky Api. Version 1 without a ui.

Simple weather app that started with Open weather API, then switched over to Dark sky.

I plan to add routing, and the option to pic specific days for more info. 

Created Using React.Js, Axios, and Bootstrap.

Check out the App at: https://weathertime67.herokuapp.com  (This is the most recent verison.)
